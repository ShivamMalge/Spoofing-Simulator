## 🚨 What is Spoofing?

**Spoofing** is a market manipulation tactic where a trader places large fake orders to create the illusion of demand or supply, only to cancel them before execution. This deceives other traders and can cause price distortions.

This simulator brings the concept to life through visual tools, inspired by the **2010 Flash Crash** and the manipulative techniques used by **Navinder Singh Sarao**.

> **Educational Use Only** — This project is designed to raise awareness about unethical trading practices and market microstructure behavior.
